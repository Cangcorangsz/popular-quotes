            <p>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know,
                everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
                joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter
                and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
                every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher
                of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner
                in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>
